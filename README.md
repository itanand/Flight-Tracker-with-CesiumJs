# Flight-Tracker-with-CesiumJs
 This is a quickstart to building 3D applications with Cesium using real-world data. We are going To build Flight Tracker Using CesiumJs, Cesium Ion  and some 3d Models.
 
 This tutorial shows you how to build your first Cesium app to visualize a real flight from San Francisco to Copenhagen, with radar data collected by FlightRadar24.
 
 You’ll learn how to:

             Set up and deploy your Cesium app on the web
             Add base layers of global 3D buildings, terrain, and imagery
             Accurately visualize an airplane from a list of positions over time

We’re going to get global satellite imagery, 3D buildings, and terrain from Cesium ion, an open platform for streaming and hosting 3D content.
