# Flight-Tracker-with-CesiumJs
 This is a quickstart to building 3D applications with Cesium using real-world data. We are going To build Flight Tracker Using CesiumJs, Cesium Ion  and some 3d Models.
 
 This tutorial shows you how to build your first Cesium app to visualize a real flight from San Francisco to Copenhagen, with radar data collected by FlightRadar24.
 
 You’ll learn how to:

             1. Set up and deploy your Cesium app on the web
             2. Add base layers of global 3D buildings, terrain, and imagery
             3. Accurately visualize an airplane from a list of positions over time

We’re going to get global satellite imagery, 3D buildings, and terrain from Cesium ion, an open platform for streaming and hosting 3D content.

<h2>Before you get started</h2>
We’re going to get global satellite imagery, 3D buildings, and terrain from Cesium ion, an open platform for streaming and hosting 3D content.

<a href="">Sign up</a> for a free Cesium ion account if you don’t already have one.

Once you’re logged in:

         1. Go to your Access Tokens tab.
         2. Note the copy button next to the default token. We’ll use this token in the next step.

<h2>Step 1. Set up your Cesium app</h2>
We’re going to create our app using CesiumJS, an open source JavaScript engine. We’ll use Glitch, an online IDE, to host our app.

     1. Click here to create a new Glitch project using the basic template we put together.
     2. Click on index.html in the left-side panel to see the app’s code.
     3. Replace your_token_here with your access token from your tokens page.
     4. Run the app by clicking Show in the top and select Next to The Code.
